I am a MSc student at the Weizmann Institute of Science, at [Schwartz lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Schwartz/).
My project is about the special regulatory ribosomes in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria


I find joy in caring for plants and observing the fruits of my labor.
